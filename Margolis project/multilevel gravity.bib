  abstract = {Using French firm-level trade data, we provide empirical support for a heterogenous firm model in which exporting requires finding a local partner in each market. In the model, contracts are incomplete, exporters must learn the reliability of their partners through experience and export behaviour is state-dependent due to matching frictions. As predicted by our theoretical model, we find that better legal institutions alleviate contracting frictions especially in sectors with large contracting problems, thereby increasing state dependence more in those sectors. Finally, hazard rates depend on the quality of local legal institutions and decline with the age of the relationship, as unreliable partners are weeded out.},

  abstract = {Roughly one-third of world trade is intrafirm trade. This paper starts by unveiling two systematic patterns in the volume of intrafirm trade. In a panel of industries, the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital intensity of the exporting industry. In a cross section of countries the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital-labor ratio of the exporting country. I then show that these patterns can be rationalized in a theoretical framework that combines a Grossman-Hart-Moore view of the firm with a Helpman-Krugman view of international trade. In particular, I develop an incomplete-contracting, property-rights model of the boundaries of the firm, which I then incorporate into a standard trade model with imperfect competition and product differentiation. The model pins down the boundaries of multinational firms as well as the international location of production, and it is shown to predict the patterns of intrafirm trade identified above. Econometric evidence reveals that the model is consistent with other qualitative and quantitative features of the data.},

However, conditional on survival, firm export growth decreases with the quality of the country's institutions. Controlling for time-varying firm unobservables and other factors, we confirm these and other predictions using a panel of Belgian exporting firms from 1995 to 2008. The results highlight the manifold implications of export experience and contracting institutions for firm dynamics in foreign markets.},

We answer this question using a much-improved data set for obtaining predicted trade and by employing methods that correct for bias in estimates of undertrading. Our results indicate that globally Africa is an underexporter in our preferred Heckman specification. This result is robust to the addition of various controls and the application of variants of the gravity model of trade. We also looked for explanations for Africa's undertrading. We found that accounting for transport and communication infrastructure reduced the undertrading effect for Africa, and in some specifications of the gravity model, the under-trading effect vanished altogether. Results from a semiparametric model provided evidence of significant nonlinear impacts from infrastructure, and the effects for a large number of African countries was significant and compared favorably with the marginal effects of infrastructure in countries on other continents and in comparable income brackets. Using this model we also found evidence of complementarity across transport and communication infrastructure, implying that much greater impacts will be likely if the infrastructure are developed jointly rather than in isolation.},

We identify two mechanisms behind these links: differences across destinations in quality valuation and in exporting required services, activities that are intensive in skilled labor. Depending on the characteristics of the source country (income, language), the theories suggest a skill-bias in export destinations. We test the theory using a panel of Argentine manufacturing firms. We find that Argentine firms exporting to high-income countries hired more skilled workers than other exporters and domestic firms. Instead, we cannot identify any causal effect of exporting per se on skill utilization. (JEL F14, F16, J24, L60, O14, O19)},

The protrade effect of immigrants is investigated along two intertwined dimensions: the complexity of traded goods and the quality of institutions in partner countries. The trade-enhancing impact of immigrants is, on average, more salient when they come from a country with weak institutions. However, this positive impact is especially large on the imports of simple products. When we turn to complex goods, for which the information channel conveyed by immigrants is the most valuable, immigration enhances imports regardless of the quality of institutions in the partner country. Regarding exports, immigrants substitute for weak institutions on both simple and complex goods.},

This paper provides a survey of the most recent literature concerning the specification and estimation methods of this equation.

This necessarily involves a careful consideration of the theoretical underpinnings since it has become clear that naive approaches to estimation lead to biased and frequently misinterpreted results. There are now several theory-consistent estimation methods and we argue against sole reliance on any one method and instead advocate a toolkit approach. One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare. We try to facilitate diffusion of best-practice methods by illustrating their application in a step-by-step cookbook mode of exposition.},

  abstract = {We develop a simple model of international trade with heterogeneous firms that is consistent with a number of stylized features of the data. In particular, the model predicts positive as well as zero trade flows across pairs of countries, and it allows the number of exporting firms to vary across destination countries. As a result, the impact of trade frictions on trade flows can be decomposed into the intensive and extensive margins, where the former refers to the trade volume per exporter and the latter refers to the number of exporters. This model yields a generalized gravity equation that accounts for the self-selection of firms into export markets and their impact on trade volumes. We then develop a two-stage estimation procedure that uses an equation for selection into trade partners in the first stage and a trade flow equation in the second. We implement this procedure parametrically, semiparametrically, and nonparametrically, showing that in all three cases the estimated effects of trade frictions are similar. Importantly, our method provides estimates of the intensive and extensive margins of trade. We show that traditional estimates are biased and that most of the bias is due not to selection but rather due to the omission of the extensive margin. Moreover, the effect of the number of exporting firms varies across country pairs according to their characteristics. This variation is large and particularly so for trade between developed and less developed countries and between pairs of less developed countries.},

Presently, the so-called Poisson pseudomaximum likelihood (PPML) with log-linear index is probably the most commonly used method. A method is proposed for panel data that targets to reconcile the pros and cons of fixed and random effects models, respectively. It applies equally to two- and three-way panel models and those with country-specific time-varying effects. It allows to filter out potential correlation between observed and unobserved heterogeneity and to identify the effects of time-invariant factors. It can also be used when panels are short in time, and to other specifications than the PPML-like gamma PML, zero-inflated, or Tobit-like models. We introduce and illustrate the proposed estimator with a study of bilateral trade flows across the European Union before the recent economic crisis.},

Trade flows of the CIS countries are not well diversified in terms of either trading partners or composition of exports. In order to compare the degree of export diversification of the CIS countries relative to other countries, we employ the gravity model that proved to be very successful in explaining geographical patterns of trade across countries. The gravity equation is estimated ‘out-of-sample’, meaning that we do not include data on trade flows of the CIS countries in the sample while calculating parameters of the gravity equation. Egger (2002) argued forcefully that the ‘in-sample’ estimation of the trade potential based on the deviation of residuals from the linear prediction is incorrect because large deviations of residuals in the gravity equation based on the in-sample method is not evidence of large deviations of trade from its potential, but rather an indicator of the model misspecification. In addition, we explicitly deal with the problems of zero trade flows and firm’s heterogeneity that become more severe at higher levels of disaggregation such as at the level of sectors of the economy.},

Institutional barriers may be one factor behind this gap, and recent research suggests that institutions are a greater obstacle to trade than tariffs. Using detailed firm-level data, we analyze how institutional quality in recipient countries affects exports by Swedish firms. Our results suggest that weak institutions in recipient countries make exports to these countries less likely and that exports to countries with weak institutions are characterized by relatively short duration and small volume. Analyzing long-term trade flows, we identified a learning process where exporters become less dependent on institutional quality in the target economy over time. More specifically, in addition to previous research that emphasize learning related to knowledge about the contracting partner and rule of law, we extend this notion and show that there is also a learning process where firms acquire knowledge about the general business climate. When learning about the contractual partner and business institutions in recipients countries takes place, exports increase relatively quickly during the first 2~years of exports and thereafter levels out. Hence, firms that are initially sensitive to weak institutions, start small, and learn how to handle foreign institutions are likely to be most successful in maintaining long-term relationships with foreign markets.},
