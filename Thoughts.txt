Two axes of research:

- what does the paper do: assess parallel trends analytically - we check the regressions and do plotting
	- For table 2 strat 1, we can do scatterplots with pop & contin var + coloring by ms status
	- For table 2 strat 2, we can simply shows robust means/ dist plots for contin vars based bivar stratif
	- Table 3 just run regress robustly

- What is DiD: Difference of means - we ask, if differences are distributed normally or not and hat role does it play 


did essentially takes diff of means -  so check if results are driven 
by outliers in distribution of differences (of outcome var)
